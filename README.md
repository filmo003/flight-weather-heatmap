# flight-weather-heatmap
An application to help correlate weather data with when you should plan sorties


## Problem Statement
Sorties are often planned without much data/insight as to how weather has historically affected launches.
We propose a simple open platform that will ingest historical weather data, and show data along with a 'heatmap' of when ideal timeframes for when to launch sorties to prevent interference from weather.
